ISSUES:
SPOF (Single Point Of Failure) -> In this design, if any server fail, the entire system will fail. So, there're many SPOF.

Downtime when maintenance needed -> When we need to run some maintenance checks on any component, they have to be put down or the server has to be turned off. Since there's only one server, the website would be experiencing a downtime.

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic -> when the server receives many requests, it is impossible to scale up.
